                Getting into a hair care routine is just like embarking on a skin care one. Once you’ve found one that
                 works 
                for you, you’ll rarely stray.

                But the process of finding that routine can seem a little daunting, especially when there’s numerous
                 options for people with the same hair type.
                
                Here’s a breakdown of everything you need to know to find the hair care ritual that’s right for you.
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Cleanse</li>
                <li>Condition</li>
                
                <li>Spot-treat</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Although your hair type and concerns will alter your hair care routine in some ways, there are a few 
                basic steps that every person can benefit from:<br>
                <br>
                <h3>Cleanse</h3> <br>
               <p> leansing is a balance between removing things like dead skin and product residueTrusted Sourcewithout 
                stripping the hair of its natural oils.<br>
                And, if you’re an avid swimmer, you don’t want to leave chlorine on your locks. The longer it sits, 
                the more time it has to strip hair of its natural elements and cause damage.
            </p>
                <br>
                
              <h3>Condition</h3> <br>
                   <p> The main ingredient of a conditioner is called a cationic surfactantTrusted Source.</bra>

                    When hair is wet, this sticks to it, coating the strands to replenish the moisture that shampoo
                     may have removed.
                </p>
                <h3>Spot-treat</h3><br>
                 <p> Spot-treating hair simply means picking out a particular area that’s bothering you and doing something to remedy it.

For example, you’re fed up with how frizzy your hair is, so you try a protein treatment.
            </p>
<br>
           </p>
                Figuring out a hair care routine may take a few days, if not a few weeks.

                But once it’s sorted, you’re well on the way to getting the hair you deserve
